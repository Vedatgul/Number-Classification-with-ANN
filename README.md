# Number-Classification-with-ANN

## Project Description
In this project, developed a model that automatically classifies numbers using ANN. The model was trained and successfully tested using the MNIST dataset. Number classification models are an important technology that can be used in many areas, from optical character recognition (OCR) applications to recognizing numbers in financial documents.

## Technologies Used
The project used TensorFlow and Keras, a popular deep learning library in Python programming language. The MNIST dataset was preferred for training and the accuracy of the model was satisfactory.

## Application Areas
Such models can be used in many areas such as check recognition in the banking sector, package labeling in the logistics sector, license plate recognition in the automotive sector. Classification models have the potential to optimize business processes by offering a wide range of applications.
